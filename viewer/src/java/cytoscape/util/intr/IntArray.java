/**
 * A dynamically growing array of integers.
 * Valid indices of this array are in the range [0, Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1].<p>
 * In the underlying implementation, this dynamically growing array
 * increases in size to adapt to elements being added (the size of the
 * underlying data structure supporting this dynamically growing array
 * is invisible to the programmer).  In the underlying implementation, this
 * dynamic array never decreases in size.  Underlying size expansions are
 * implemented such that the operation of expanding in size is amortized over
 * the constant time complexity of inserting new elements into this
 * dynamic array.<p>
 * An instance of this class is serializable; however, serialized instances of
 * this class should not be stored in a persistent manner because the
 * serialization implemented in this class makes no attempt at handling
 * class versioning.
