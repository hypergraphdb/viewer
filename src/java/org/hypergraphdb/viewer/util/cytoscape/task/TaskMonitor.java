	 * guess as to what percentage of the task it has completed; repeated calls
	 * to this method do not guarantee ascending values of <code>percent</code>.

	 * The parent application will use this information submitted by the child
	 * process to present a percent completed progress bar to a user, for
	 * example.  Some tasks may choose to go from 0 to 100 on all subtasks
	 * which are executed in order by a task.  For example,
	 * <blockquote><pre>
	 * m_taskMonitor.setPercentCompleted(0);
	 * m_taskMonitor.setStatus("fetching URL");
	 * // fetch URL

	 * m_taskMonitor.setStatus("parsing webpage");
